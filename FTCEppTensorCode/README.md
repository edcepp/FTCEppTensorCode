## FTC TensorFlow Ojbect Detection with Error Handling and Gold Mineral Offset Computation

LinkedIn has identified the Machine Learning Engineer as one of the five top emerging jobs in 2018. The top skills include Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and TensorFlow. QuaComm has integrated it into the FTC STK giving our teams an opportunity to learn and leverage this emerging technology.  This tutorial shows you how to write the java code required to locate objects using TensorFlow. Once an object of interest is located the program computes the horizontal offset from the center of the screen. Future tutorials will use this offset to move the robot toward the targeted game piece.
